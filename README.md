# Face-Recognition-with-Occlusion-Handling
The project implements a robust face recognition system capable of handling occlusions like masks and disguises. It includes utilities to verify image data quality and trains a recognition model using HOG or CNN-based encoders. The system is optimized for both CPU and GPU, ensuring flexible deployment.
